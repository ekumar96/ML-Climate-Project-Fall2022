Found, downloaded, and parsed dataset
Brainstormed applications of dataset
- could combine with other datasets (have year and country data)
- linear regression applications
- perhaps try to establish causal links
Things to consider:
- who are my stakeholders?
- decision trees
- look at causal

10/11/22
- Added .ipynb
- Made basic roadmap of steps to take for project
- May decide to do colab instead

10/31/22
- Created Google Colab notebook
- Imported and Did work on data
	- Surveyed data
	- Removed missing values
	- Visualized Data

11/15/22
- Data was preprocessed
	- Scaled continuous data
	- one hot/ordinally encoded categorical data
	- Seperated into training/test data
- Wrote abstract

11/22/22

11/29/22
- Implemented Elementary Causal models
	- Implemented Microsoft DoWhy model
	- Created causal inference graph
	- Experimented with causation from different treatments:
		- avg_temp
		- rainfall
		- pesticides
	- Found some strong causal links
	- Attempted to refute causal links by performing Robustness Checks
		- random_common_cause
		- placebo_treatment_refuter
		- data_subset_refuter

12/2/22
- Cleaned up code, reran all models and created graphs/visualizations
- Performed inference on models for interesting predictions
- Collected graphs/visualizations for paper and presentation

12/4/22
- Created Slides and Recorded video

Goals:
- Work on paper
