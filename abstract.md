# Abstract

In recent years, the accuracy and reliability of crop yield predictions have become increasingly important for a variety of stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, and food security experts. Farmers in particular may find this valuable as they can use the forecasts to organize their planting and harvesting operations more effectively. This paper explores the use of Machine Learning and Causal Inference models for predicting worldwide crop yield. Our results suggest that we can develop a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast crop yields using a combination of data sources, as well as a causal model that can grant further insight into why these outcomes may occur. Overall, we hope that these results will provide a valuable starting point for further study and will support sustainable decision-making in the agriculture industry and prevent food scarcity worldwide in the face of climate change.
