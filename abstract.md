As Climate change effects continue to worsen, and our machine learning models improve and data becomes more widely available, the intersection between these two fields is increasingly becoming a more and more active and impactful field. 

Agriculture plays a critical role in the health and well-being of billions around the world, and can significantly affect the global economy. As climate change impacts worsen and lead to floods, droughts, and increased CO2 in the atmosphere, crop yields are changing. To combat global hunger and ensure food security in these uncertain times, crop yield prediction is essential. 

In order to predict crop yield, we evaluate historical variables such as rainfall, temperature, pesticides, etc. We believe that this will lead to a robust prediction model that can effectively aid in the mitigation of food scarcity risks.
